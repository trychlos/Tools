# Synopsis:
#
#    The Tools Project gets some site-wide defaults from a
#    'defaults.ini' configuration file.
#
#    The 'defaults.ini' configuration is successively searched for in
#    each TTPROOT/etc/ttp directory, in the order they have been defined
#    from the login shell profile of the currently running account.
#
#    The first found wins.

# logsroot:
#   This key defines the root of the TTP logs directory.
#   The value must be an absolute path, or a function name.
#   If a function name, it must provides an absolute path on stdout;
#   optional arguments to the function may be provided after the
#   function name.
#   Hardcoded default value is /tmp.
#   This value may be overriden on a per-node basis.
