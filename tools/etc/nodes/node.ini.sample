# The node configuration file defines configuration for the execution
# node. This means that services which run on this node must also be
# described here.
#
# In order to make the writing more easy, some macros are recognized
# here:
#
# - @N: the name of this execution node
#       scope: all the node configuration file
#
# - @S: the mnemonic of the service
#       scope: the service definition 

## Node configuration

# environment:
#   This key defines the execution environment of this node
#   (see docs/0-Concepts for a recall of what is an execution
#    environment though each site may have its own definition).
#   The environment identifier may be any string, though only the first
#   word is considered.
#   There is no default: if not specified, then the node will get an
#   empty environment identifier, and will be considered in the same
#   environment that other nodes which have this same empty environment.

# <node> : environment : <environment_identifier>
# @N : environment : <environment_identifier>

# logsroot:
#   This key defines the root of the TTP logs directory for this
#   execution node, and overrides the site-wide defaults defined in
#   TTPROOT/etc/ttp/defaults.ini.
#   The value must be an absolute path, or a function name.

# <node> : logsroot : /an/absolute/path
# <node> : logsroot : a_function_name [<maybe> [<with> [<args>]]]
# @N : logsroot : /an/absolute/path
# @N : logsroot : a_function_name [<maybe> [<with> [<args>]]]
