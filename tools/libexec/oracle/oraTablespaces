# Synopsis:
#
# (I): 1. service mnemonic
#
# (O): stdout: SQL output
#
# This function has been forked from oracle.sh info, from
#  tools-v1.0-ixis.is-oct.2006-rev.12730 project
#
# Other requests of interest:
#
# 1.  select distinct(tablespace_name) from dba_tablespaces order by tablespace_name;
#
# 2.  select tablespace_name, sum(bytes_used), sum(bytes_used)-sum(bytes_free), sum(bytes_free)
#       from v$temp_space_header
#       group by tablespace_name
#     this request shows a TEMP tablespace 100% used
#
# 3.  select tablespace_name, sum(tablespace_size), sum(tablespace_size)-sum(free_space), sum(free_space)
#       from dba_temp_free_space
#       group by tablespace_name
#     this request shows a TEMP tablespace just a bit used in an empty
#     database, which appears to be more acceptable.
#
# pwi 2013- 6-12 creation
# pwi 2013- 6-14 add TEMP tablespaces
# pwi 2017- 6-21 publish the release at last
