# Synopsis:
#
#   This shell function is expected to be sourced from inside a bash- or
#   a korn-derived login shell profile:
#
#     # Initialize The Tools Project
#     TTP=/opt/trychlos.pwi/Tools; . ${TTP}/libexec/bootstrap/sh_profile
#
#   Setting up PATH and FPATH variables requires an in-process execution.
#   The required functions have to be explicitely preloaded.
#   They have been grouped together in a single file to make this
#   preload easyer.
#
# pwi 2013- 6-11 creation
# pwi 2015- 7- 2 update to trychlos.pwi
# pwi 2017- 6-21 publish the release at last
