# Synopsis:
#
#   Initialize PATH and FPATH variables.
#   Setup the initial default execution node.
#   Address the main functions directory.
#
#   This script is supposed to be sourced from inside a bash- or a
#   korn-derived login shell profile:
#
#     # Initialize The Tools Project
#     TTP=/opt/trychlos.pwi/Tools; . ${TTP}/libexec/bootstrap/bash_setup
#
#   The Tools Project bootstrapping process actually involves two
#   distinct steps :
#
#   - initialize the PATH and FPATH variables, which has to be run once,
#     in a decreasing order of precedence, for each TTPROOT tree the
#     user may want consider
#
#   - setup an initial execution node, which has to be run once only.

# replace here '/dir' with your own TTPROOT pathname
# this may be called several times
