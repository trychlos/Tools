# Synopsis:
#
#   Discover and setup the default initial execution node.
#   Relies on the TTP variable having been set by the caller.
#
#   As bash does not honor the FPATH variable, we have to explicitely
#   preload all needed functions.
#
#   This code is expected to be run only once, after having setup
#   all desired versions of The Tools Project (see bootstrap/sh_setup).
