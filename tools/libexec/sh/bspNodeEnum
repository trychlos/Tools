# Synopsis:
#
#   List the logical nodes available on the host, according to the
#   'logical.re' regular expression file, ending with the host name
#   itself.
#
# (I): -
#
# (O): - nodes with a configuration file are displayed on stdout
#
# BootstrappingProcess:
#
#   This function is involved in the bootstrapping process, either
#   as part of the FPATH initialization, or as part of the execution
#   node setup.
#   Because of that, it must be executed as an in-process run.
#   Consequently, it has to be reviewed each time another login shell
#   has to be managed.
#
# pwi 1998-10-21 creation
# pwi 2002- 2-28 tools are moved to the physical machine
# pwi 2002- 6-22 logical are identified by regular expression
# pwi 2003- 6-11 replace df by mount (because of NFS stale mounts)
# pwi 2006-10-27 tools become The Tools Project, released under GPL
# pwi 2013- 7- 4 port to Tools v2
# pwi 2013- 7-30 fix #31: rename osEnumFSMountPoints to bspOSEnumMountPoints
# pwi 2017- 6-21 publish the release at last
