# Synopsis:
#
#   As of ksh-93 v20120821 on Fedora 17, we are unable to declare an
#   associative array with typeset -A, whose we could pass the name as
#   an argument to a function, this function updating the array with
#   key=value pairs.
#   The update of pseudo-globals array only works with indexed arrays
#   (which may even be yet undeclared when entering in the function).
#
#   The specified variable name is defined here as an array set with
#   the found keywords (service identifier or node name) in the order
#   of their apparition in the configuration file:
#
#     <varname> = (
#         <node>
#         <cft>
#         <oracle>
#         ...
#         )
#
#   For each keyword, a variable <varname>_<keyword> keeps track of
#   the count of lines found for this keyword:
#
#     <varname>_<keyword> = 3
#
#   The <varname>_<keyword>_<i>, where <i>=0..n-1, keeps the original
#   line with the character separator, after macro substitution and
#   unrelevant spaces stripping:
#
#     <varname>_<keyword>_<i> = environment:@tryclos.org
#
#   The original line is kept as an easier way to interpret it when
#   searching for a value with a field selection list (cf. confGetKey).
#
# (I): 1. name of the in-memory array variable
#      2. path to the configuration file to be loaded in memory
#      3. (opt.) character used as field separator
#         defaults to ':'
#
# (O): -
