# Synopsis:
#
#   Prepend a value to a colon-separated variable, making sure it is
#   not registered twice.
#
# (I): 1. initial colon-separated value
#      2. value to be prepended
#
# (O): (stdout): new value
#
# BootstrappingProcess:
#
#   This function is involved in the bootstrapping process, either
#   as part of the FPATH initialization, or as part of the execution
#   node setup.
#   Because of that, it must be executed as an in-process run.
#   Consequently, it has to be reviewed each time another login shell
#   has to be managed.
