# Synopsis:
#
#   Initialize common internal variables. 
#
# BootstrappingProcess:
#
#   This file is involved in the bootstrapping process, either
#   as part of the FPATH initialization, or as part of the execution
#   node setup.
#   Because of that, it must be sourced as an in-process run.
#   Consequently, it has to be reviewed each time another login shell
#   has to be managed.
