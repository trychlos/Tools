# Synopsis:
#
#   The current running environment is not expected to be guessed, but
#   should be read from the node configuration file.
#
# (I): 1. (opt.) absolute pathname of a node's configuration file
#                or node name
#                Defaults is to search for in the ttp_node_keys
#                array which holds the configuration for the current
#                node.
#
# (O): - stdout: environment identifier
#
# pwi 2013- 2-16 creation
# pwi 2013- 7- 5 get environment from in-memory keys array
# pwi 2017- 6-21 publish the release at last
