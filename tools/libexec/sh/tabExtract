# Synopsis:
#
#   If more than one value is found, then the configuration file is
#   malformed: a warning is issued in the logs and only the first value
#   is returned. 
#
#   Selection fields are to be passed as a comma-separated string:
#   "<num_field>=<searched_value>[,<num_field>=<searched_value[,...]]
#   where 'num_field' is counted from 1
#
# (I): 1. (opt) character used as field separator (':')
#      2. (opt) comma-separated string of the list of selection fields
#               (empty means all)
#      3. (opt) comma-separated list of desired fields
#               (empty means all)
#
# (O): stdout: found value is echoed
