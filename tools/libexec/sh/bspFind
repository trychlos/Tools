# Synopsis:
#
# (I): 1. end of the pathname of the searched file;
#         this may be just a basename, or includes some of last
#         subdirectory levels;
#         e.g. mynode.ini, or etc/ttp/logicals.re
#
# (O): stdout: full pathname of the first readable candidate
#              (note that returned candidate may be empty after
#               comments removing)
#
# BootstrappingProcess:
#
#   This function is involved in the bootstrapping process, either
#   as part of the FPATH initialization, or as part of the execution
#   node setup.
#   Because of that, it must be executed as an in-process run.
#   Consequently, it has to be reviewed each time another login shell
#   has to be managed.
