# Synopsis:
#
# (I): 1. (opt) character used as field separator (':')
#
# (O): stdout: filtered stdin stream
#
# BootstrappingProcess:
#
#   This function is involved in the bootstrapping process, either
#   as part of the FPATH initialization, or as part of the execution
#   node setup.
#   Because of that, it must be executed as an in-process run.
#   Consequently, it has to be reviewed each time another login shell
#   has to be managed.
