#   are defined on all machines, with the same shell.
#
#   If this is not the case, add a target host as a second parameter
#   and ssh to the host to require the correct configuration.
#
# (I): 1. the account name
#
# (O): [stdout] the full pathname to the login shell binary of the
#               account
