# Synopsis:
#
#   If the TTP_LOGICAL environment variable is set, then it is the
#   preferred candidate. If not found, then fall back to the usual
#   search, which eventually may or may not fall back to the standard
#   host.
#
#   TTP_LOGICAL only applies when using the logical machine paradigm,
#   because there is no sense in trying to designate in advance a
#   preferred logical when only working with standard hosts.
#
#   This function may return an empty value, when the logical machines
#   paradigm is in use (regular expression is not empty), and no
#   logical is found in the physical server.
#
# (I): -
#
# (O): - stdout: best logical name candidate
