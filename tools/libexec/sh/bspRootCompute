# Synopsis:
#
#   The list of TTPROOT paths is computed from the ordered list of
#   FPATH, making sure at least one of bindir, etcdir or fndir
#   subdirectory exists.
#
#   If not already present, the TTPROOT path of the currently running
#   command is appended to this list.
#
# (I): 1. (opt) full pathname of the command
#
# (O): stdout: ttp_roots is echoed as a colon (:) separated list
#
# BootstrappingProcess:
#
#   This function is involved in the bootstrapping process, either
#   as part of the FPATH initialization, or as part of the execution
#   node setup.
#   Because of that, it must be executed as an in-process run.
#   Consequently, it has to be reviewed each time another login shell
#   has to be managed.
#
# pwi 2013- 2-16 creation
# pwi 2013- 6-27 the currently running command goes to the end of the list
# pwi 2017- 6-21 publish the release at last
