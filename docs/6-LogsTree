 The logs tree
 =============

 The Tools Project by itself logs all run commands and their arguments,
 along with all error messages, in a log file.

 All verbs which need a temporary file should use the 'pathGetTempFile'
 function: this function just allocates a command-dedicated directory
 and create the required tempfile in it, ensuring that it will be
 unique.

 Log and temporary files are created under a root log directory. This
 root log directory is addressed on a per machine basis. A site-wide
 default can also be set.

 It was one of the main first required feature of The Tools Project to
 keep all its log and temporary files: this is the safest way to be
 sure to have an available audit track when needed, and is so just a
 must-have in any industrialization process.

 More, TTP design let you choose a dynamic directory path, just by
 writing only one shell function (see 'pathGetDailyLogsdir' for an
 example of such a function).

 This function may perfectly be installed in a site-dedicated tree (the
 same that you are probably using to store your configuration files),
 and so be used without modifying the TTP code by itself.

 If no root log directory is defined neither in the machine
 configuration file nor in the site wide configuration file (but this
 would be bad!), then temporary files are created in /tmp.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Configuring
 ===========

 The Tools Project takes advantage of the constant availability of a
 persistent log tree. The root path of this directory is dynamically
 computed from the .ini configuration files:

 - first, from TTPROOT/etc/nodes/<node>.ini, key=logsdir in the node
   configuration;

 - falling back to TTPROOT/etc/defaults.ini, key=logsdir

 - falling back to /tmp.

 The 'logsdir' property may be set:

 - either to a full path, beginning with a '/'
   e.g. '/mynode/var'

 - either to the name of a ksh function which is expected to display
   the root log directory on its standard output;
   e.g. 'pathGetDailyLogsDir' wuld display '/mynode/var/20130706'
