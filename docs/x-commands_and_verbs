 Commands and verbs
 ==================

   Commands
   --------
   As all *nix-like commands, 'command.sh' commands are searched for in
   directories specified in PATH variable. Tough they can also be run
   by specifying their full path, this is not the easier way (but you
   are free to choose this way).

   Commands are supposed to be stored in and addressed from a TTPROOT/bin
   directory, which is so the directory that should be referred to in
   the PATH variable.

   The Tools Project reserves some subdirectories for its own usage:

   - bin/ which should be addressed by the PATH variable
   - etc/ where are searched the configuration files
   - libexec/ which must be addressed by the FPATH variable via its sh/
     subdirectory (this is mandatory)
   - plus a subdirectory per command

   so we cannot have any command with these same names.

   When only the command is entered, then the library displays the list
   of available verbs.

   Verbs
   -----
   Verbs implement actions relative to the command.

   Verbs are searched for in directories derived from those specified in
   the FPATH environment variable, where each directory specified is
   considered as a TTPROOT/libexec/sh one, and verbs are searched for in
   a TTPROOT/<command> directory. The first one found, whichever be its
   extension, is considered.

   All verbs must implement 'help' boolean option for displaying online
   help.

   When only the verb in entered after the command, then the library
   displays the full help relative to this verb.

   Functions
   ---------
   The Tools Project library is mainly written in Korn Shell (ksh), and
   makes an heavy use of shell functions. These functions are supposed
   to be stored in and addressed from a TTPROOT/libexec/sh directory,
   which must be referred to by the FPATH variable.
