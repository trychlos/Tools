 Prerequisites
 =============

 The Tools Project has following minimal requirements:

   > ksh-93 (or newer) available as /bin/ksh
   > perl 5 (or newer) available as /usr/bin/perl

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Installation
 ============

 The Tools Project tree can be installed in any directory you want,
 either in a local or in a nfs-shared one. The only requirement is that
 the filesystem must support the executable bit.

 In the rest of this document, the directory where you have chosen to
 install the Tools Project tree will be called TTPROOT.

 If your site implements the 'logical machine' notion,
 see docs/3-LogicalMachine for why it is not a good idea to install The
 Tools Project in the logical tree.

   Structure of the TTP tree
   -------------------------
   The Tools Project tree has the following structure:

     TTPROOT/
       |
       +- bin/                 Hosts the commands
       |                       Is adressed via the PATH variable
       |
       +- etc/                 Configuration files
       |   |
       |   +- nodes/           The nodes configuration files
       |   |
       |   +- private/         Password files
       |   |
       |   +- ttp/             Global TTP configuration
       |
       +- libexec/             Functions and subroutines
       |   |
       |   +- sh/              Hosts shell functions
       |   |                   Is adressed via the FPATH variable
       |   |
       |   +- perl/            Perl modules
       |   |
       |   +- <command1>/      Functions specific to <command1> command
       |                       (if any)
       |
       +- <command1>/          Hosts the verbs for the <command1>
       |                       command
       |
       +- <command2>/          Hosts the verbs for the <command2>
                               command

   The above structure explains the reason for why a command name must
   be chosen to not be in 'bin', 'etc' or 'libexec': one could not
   create the corresponding verb directory.

 Obviously, all users of The Tools Project must have read and execute
 permissions of all of each TTP trees.

 It would may be a good idea to define a group and an account which
 would be the owner of each TTP trees, and to make sure all users of
 The Tools Project be a member of this group.

 Addressing The Tools Project
 ============================

   User environment
   ----------------
   In order to use The Tools Project, each user must initialize his/her
   user environment.
 
   1. Mandatory: address the shell functions

      The Tools Project is not self-addressable. You have to preset at
      least the FPATH variable in the execution environment of your
      running shell:

        FPATH=$FPATH:TTPROOT/libexec/sh

      If you are working with several versions of TTP, then each one
      must be adressed in a consistant manner, the formers being
      precedence on the laters.

   2. Optional: address the commands

      Though this is not strictly required in order the TTP be
      runnable, and it would be perfectly acceptable to address the
      commands by their full filename, we strongly suggest to update
      your PATH:

        PATH=PATH:TTPROOT/bin

   3. Mandatory: define TTP_SHDIR variable

      Because The Tools Project supports the 'logical machine' paradigm,
      there is some situations where it cannot rely on the FPATH
      variable.
      A TTP_SHDIR must be defined to address (one of) the main shell
      functions directory.

   4. Mandatory: define the initial execution node

      This is done by calling the ". ttp.sh switch --node <name>"
      command.

   As a convenience, The Tools Project provides in the
   libexec/bootstrap/ subdirectory some scripts which may be called
   from a user profile to make this initialization easyer:

     TTP=<dir>; . ${TTP}/libexec/bootstrap/sh_profile
     TTP=<dir>; . ${TTP}/libexec/bootstrap/sh_node

   or:

     TTP=<dir>; source ${TTP}/libexec/bootstrap/csh_profile
     TTP=<dir>; source ${TTP}/libexec/bootstrap/csh_node

   Remote execution
   ----------------
   a) Ssh key

     When a command targets a service which is available on another
     node, The Tools Project automatically ssh to the target node and
     re-executes itself.

     You have to install the required ssh public keys in all possible
     target accounts/hosts in order these ssh's may be password-less.

     We suggest defining a single ssh key, shared among all users/hosts,
     dedicated to this usage.

   b) Bootstrapping

     While The Tools Project relies on an initialized user's environment,
     ssh does not open a login shell when it executes a remote command
     (i.e. does not initialize the user's environment).

     The Tools Project provides a TTPROOT/libexec/bootstrap/sh_remote
     script, which has to be adapted to the user's shell, and installed
     in the user home directory with the '.ttp_remote' name.
