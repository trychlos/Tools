 Introduction
 ============

 Logical machines are historic components of high-availability clusters.
 Strictly speaking, a logical machine is fully determined with:
 - a dedicated IP address, and a corresponding dedicated name in the DNS
 - a filesystem, mounted on '/<name>'.

 They are said 'logical' because they do not have an OS by themselves,
 but take advantage of the host's OS.

 Due to the storage nature, the logical machine may be successively
 switched to different hosts, the move being due to maintenance,
 performance or availability reasons. 

 There may be several logical machines hosted on a single host, each
 one belonging to a different environment.

 As a consequence, it is possible that several execution environments
 be found on a single host.

 From The Tools Project point of view, a logical machine is an
 execution node by itself, whatever be the host, and so has (must have)
 its own node configuration file.

 The notion of a "logical machine" has some inherent drawbacks, that
 the TTP must deal with:

 - as the logical machine must come with all its resources when it is
   moved from a physical host to another, all services, applications
   and more generally all managed softwares should/must be installed
   under the /<name> root filesystem (not really an issue for the TTP,
   but can be for integrators);

 - when examining the process list, TTP must deal with many processes
   which are not run from the current logical machine; this may be an
   inconvenience when trying to identify a system resource (used CPU,
   or IPC, or somewhat);

 - as all logical machines share the same operating system, TTP
   cannot know which will be the current logical machine when it
   connects to a host; a special bootstrap process must be setup,
   and a special 'switch' verb is required in order to address a
   logical machine or another;

 - last, TTP requires that all logical machine names be identified by
   a regular expression written in TTPROOT/etc/ttp/logicals.re.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Identifying available logical machines
 ======================================

 Though an host name may be identified at runtime just by running a
 standard *nix command (uname), The Tools Project relies on a provided
 regular expression to identify the logical machine.

 This regular expression must be specified in the site-wide
 TTPROOT/etc/ttp/logicals.re configuration file. If the file is not
 found or empty, then The Tools Project will consider that the site
 does not use the logical machine paradigm.

 Contrarily, if the TTPROOT/etc/ttp/logicals.re configuration file
 exists and is not empty, then the found regular expression is used
 to identify the name of the logical machines by comparing it to the
 filesystems mounted on the root (/).

 The comparison applies on the first directory level, after having
 removed the leading slash.

 This way, The Tools Project is able to automatically determine the
 list of logical machines available on the host.

 As a summary, logical machines available on a host are identified as:
 
  1. a non-empty regular expression is found in
     TTPROOT/etc/ttp/logicals.re;

  2. a file system is mounted under /<name>, where <name> satisfies the
     previously found regular expression;

  3. a TTPROOT/etc/nodes/<name>.ini nod configuration file exists.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Default logical at login time
 =============================

 When a user logs into a host, he/she cannot choose his/her initial
 execution node. Instead The Tools Project does its best to propose
 and setup a default execution node.

 At login time, the default execution node is the first node found
 when enumerating:

  1. the logical machines available on the host (if any)
  2. the host itself.

 It may so happen that no execution node may be set of this host.

 When the user wishes change his/her current execution node, it must
 executes the command:

   ". ttp.sh switch -node <node>"

 Note the leading dot, as this command is expected to modify the user
 environment.

 This command is useless in a site which does not make use of the
 logical machine paradigm, but is still used internally by The Tools
 Project in remote executions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Why do not install The Tools Project inside the logical tree ?
 ==============================================================

 The bootstrapping process at login time involves some TTP code.

 Adressing this code at login may fail if the logical machine is not
 present at this time on the host.

 As another drawback, when the logical machine paradigm is used in a
 site, there is typically many more logical machines that hosts.

 Distributing a new version of The Tools Project may so be (much)
 longer.

 For these two reasons, it is always better to install The Tools
 Project either in the hosts, on in a centralized NFS place (or as
 a mix of the two solutions).
