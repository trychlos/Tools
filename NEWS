 Version 1.1
 ===========

	v 1.0 was already a mature version, which use to be daily used in
	some IT sites. It has been successfully ran under AIX and SunOS 
	environments.

	v 1.1-beta1 is this same version, released under GPL.
	Some modifications have been made :

	- all code is now under SVN
	- standard GNU files are created
	- the target tree is defined
	- port and test under GNU/Linux 2.4
	- move tools initialization code from site specific profile to a
	dedicated bootstrap file
	- move functions to a dedicated sh/ subdirectory
	- accept sh and bash users
	- logicals accept more default values, so that a minimal work can
	be made with an empty logical.ini configuration file
	- a logical machine is no more needed to obtain a minimal set of
	functions (ex. gec.sh list)
